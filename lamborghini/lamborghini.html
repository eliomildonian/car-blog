							<h1>FIRST GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Murcielago 2001-2006)<br><br>
							When Lamborghini introduced the Murcielago in 2001, it was already owned by Volkswagen Group, and it had enough money to create a unique supercar.<br>
							The carmaker already knew that it had to adapt to new customers and that the hard-core enthusiasts would have to deal with the all-wheel-drive systems and the new design. Moreover, Volkswagen brought Luc Donkerwolke onboard, and he penned the car with angular shapes but managed to create an aerodynamic shape.<br>
							With a 4 ft (1.2 meters) height and an unusually wide stance, the Murcielago was the shocking-looking vehicle that Lamborghini needed. The car's angular-shaped headlights and the big air intakes in the apron made it look like a hungry beast ready to eat everyone and everything in its path. The designer didn't forget that such a supercar needs impressive cooling areas, so he developed adjustable side air-scoops to cool the engines. As a brand-specific signature, the scissors doors were kept.<br>
							Despite its wide stance, the Murcielago was actually pretty cramped inside. There was a tall center console between the sport bucket seats and a center stack that supported the sound system and the HVAC controls. On top of it, there were a pair of round vents that clearly didn't match the car's angular shapes. But they worked fine, and customers didn't complain. Inside the instrument cluster, Lamborghini placed two big dials for the speedometer and tachometer while the rest of the gauges and warning lights flanked them.<br>
							Like its predecessor, the Diablo, this 2001 Lamborghini featured a V12 engine placed behind the cabin. It was a 6.2-liter unit mated either with a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic. Power went in all corners via a viscous center differential.</p>

							<h1>SECOND GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Murcielago LP 640 2006-2010)<br><br>
							Lamborghini launched the Murcielago in 2001 and, in 2006, its originally 580 hp engine didn't look that much anymore, facing stiff competition from other brands. So, it came with the LP640 and some subtle aesthetic improvements.<br>
							Lamborghini was bought by the Volkswagen Group in 1998 from a Malaysian investment group. Its turbulent history with ups and downs was calmed down under German ownership and it was placed under Audi control. That is why it had some Audi parts in some of its models. But the Murcielago didn't have that many connections with any of the German cars.<br>
							On the outside, there was a new chin under the short front overhang, and in the rear, there was an option for a glass-covered engine lid, so the owner could brag with the V12 underneath. The car was big and powerful and its status as one of the greatest supercars ever made was rocked by other car manufacturers, including Porsche and, of course, the traditional opposition from Ferrari. In the rear, on the lower side, there was a tailpipe with huge dimensions. It could be easily mistaken with the drainage for a street.<br>
							The luxurious interior featured leather seats, a leather-covered dashboard and center console, and aluminum pedals. The gearshift lever was straight-up from the center console.<br>
							But Lamborghini didn't make the LP640 just by adding some horses, a chin, and an exhaust. It also tweaked the suspension and improved the brakes. As an option, carbo-ceramic brakes were offered.</p>

							<h1>THIRD GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Murcielago LP 670-4 SuperVeloce 2009-2010)<br><br>
							The Murcielago LP 670 SuperVeloce was first unveiled to the media in March 2009 and represents, in Lamborghini's words, a purist version of the Murcielago LP 640. The car features a redesigned aerodynamic body with a large rear spoiler that increases down force for improved vehicle stability at high speeds. This hardcore sports version of the LP 640 is 100 kgs (220 lbs) lighter and boasts optimized valve timing and a reworked intake system in order to boost the power up to 670 hp. The Lamborghini Murcielago LP 670 SuperVeloce will only be produced in 350 units. Production of the Murcielago ended on November 5, 2010, with a total run of 4,099 cars.</p>

							<h1>FIRST GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Huracan LP 610-4 2014-2019)<br><br>
							When you’re out to replace a car like the Lamborghini Gallardo, the most successful model in the brand’s history, you just know you have to keep everything razor-sharp. This seems to be the way for Lamborghini’s Huracan, or LP610-4 as pedants call it.<br>
							Carbon fiber has found its way next to the aluminum in the chassis, which means that the supercar now has a dry weight of 1,422 kg (3,135 lbs). The Italians also talk about a stifness increase, but actual figures are replaced with metaphors.<br>
							At the center of the Lamborghini Huracan, we find a reworked version of the Gallardo’s 5.2-liter V10 unit. The powerplant gains direct injection, mixing this with indirect injection to offer "Iniezione Diretta Stratificata" (IDS). The results? 610 HP at 8,250 rpm and a maximum torque of 560 Nm (413 lb-ft) at 6.500 rpm. At the same time, the fuel consumption has been lowered to 12.5 l/100 km (18.8 mpg).<br>
							Gone is the single-clutch automated manual - the e-gear was replaced with Lamborghini’s version of the VW Group’s seven-speed double clutch automatic, the Lamborghini Doppia Frizione" (LDF).<br>
							The list of tech updates also includes goodies like electronic control for the AWD system. Oh and let’s not forget the ceramic brakes. Dipping into the list of optionals, we find treats such as Lamborghini Dynamic Steering (with variable steering ratio) and magneto-rheologic suspension. All these features may seem normal in the supercar world, but the Gallardo’s decade-old design meant it didn’t offer such amenities.</p>

							<h1>SECOND GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Huracan LP 580-2 (RWD) 2016-2019)<br><br>
							Lamborghini ended its customers' wait and introduced the two-wheel-drive Hurracan in 2016, and the result was a less performant and more playful car.<br>
							Lamborghini was not keen to make an all-wheel-drive car in the '80s, but it had to admit that the engine power became too high for a two-wheel-drive vehicle. But in 1993, the Italian carmaker made the Diablo VT with a viscous center differential (VT stood for Viscous Traction). When Audi stepped in, the German carmaker pushed the carmaker in the all-wheel-drive era for most of its models. But somewhere, the Italians knew that a Lamborghini driver would seek the traction limit and would try to make some donuts in a parking lot or a slide on a track-day. So Lamborghini made the Huracan 580-2 specifically for them.<br>
							From the outside, there were slight differences between the all-wheel-drive Hurracan and the 580-2 version. On the rear-wheel-drive version, the carmaker added a horizontal slat in each of the front wide side-scoops. In the middle, the lower lip was black regardless of the car's color, while on the all-wheel-drive model, it was body-colored.<br>
							Inside, the 2016 Gallardo 580-2 featured a pair of sport bucket seats with high bolstering on their sides. The carmaker placed the buttons for the transmission, the parking brake, and the engine starter on the massive center console. The car was available exclusively with a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) transmission with paddle shifters mounted on the steering column.<br>
							Lamborghini installed the same 5.2-liter V-12 from its all-wheel-drive sibling in the engine compartment, but the engineers de-tuned it by 30 ponies to 580 hp. In addition, since the car's front was lighter after the engineers removed the differential and the drive-shafts, the mass distribution changed to a 40/60 ratio.</p>

							<h1>THIRD GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Huracan Performante 2017-2019)<br><br>
							Lamborghini was not pleased with the performances offered by the Huracan. It added more power and made it faster with the 2017 Huracan Performante (performance) series.<br>
							In March 2017, Lamborghini unveiled the Huracan Performante at the Geneva Motor Show. It was one of the special editions made by the Italian car-manufacturer for its vehicles. It was usual for brands such as Lamborghini, Ferrari, or Aston Martin to build special editions for already launched vehicles and sell them with more money, even if under the skin it was the same car. But the Performante was more than that.<br>
							At the front, the new design for the bumper. It had no grilles, emphasizing lightweight materials, efficiency and sportiness. The side-sills were bigger and were built from carbon-fiber. In the back, a clear cover for the engine compartment was enhanced with more air-scoops. The rear, massive, wing, was crafted from one piece, using the Forged Composite technology.<br>
							Inside, the air vents, paddles, door handles and the center console were made from Forged Composite. The driver was in touch with the active aerodynamics’ activities: not only through the car’s performance but from the special ALA graphic in the dashboard display.<br>
							The Huracan Performante was stiffer than the coupe version. It was fitted with magnetorheological adaptive dampers, for higher cornering speeds. The car was 40 kg (88 lbs) lighter than the standard Huracan, which lead to better 0 to 100 kph (0-62 mph) time.</p>

							<h1>FOURTH GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Huracan Evo 2019-Present)<br><br>
							The 2019 Lamborghini Huracan received a facelift, an improvement for the next decade. The new engine offered is the 5.2 liters naturally-aspirated Lamborghini V10 engine but upgraded for more power and a powerful sound.<br>
							Amongst the new technologies that made this engine magnificent, there are titanium intake valves and a lighter exhaust system. The Huracan Evo produces 640 hp and 600 Nm (442 lb.-ft) of torque. For the transmission, Lamborghini has opted for a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox, which sends the power to all four wheels. Due to this combination of powerplant and gearbox, the Huracan Evo gets a 0-100 kph (0-62 mph) time of 2.9 seconds and a top speed of 325 kph (202 mph).<br>
							The Huracán EVO features Lamborghini's new rear-wheel steering and a torque vectoring system working on all four wheels, while at the heart of the car is a new feature called Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Integrata (LDVI): a Central Processing Unit that controls every aspect of the car's dynamic behavior.<br>
							A new 8.4" HMI capacitive touchscreen, located in the center console just above the start button, puts connectivity at the driver's fingertips, with multi-finger gesture control. Governing car functions including seats, climate and the status of the LDVI system in real-time it also puts all infotainment, such as Apple CarPlay with smartphone integration, at the cabin occupants' disposal.<br>
							A multimedia system incorporates connected navigation and entertainment, including web radio and video player. Android Auto is not available, but Android-based smartphones can connect to the audio system for telephone use.</p>

							<h1>FIFTH GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Huracan Evo RWD 2019-Present)<br><br>
							Unveiled less than a year after its all-wheel-drive big brother, the Lamborghini Evo RWD is a true driver's supercar in the modern Lamborghini lineup. Just like the AWD Huracan Evo, the rear-wheel-drive model has a front/rear weight distribution of 40/60 and sits on a double wishbone suspension with overlapped quadrilaterals and passive shock absorbers. That being said, the electro-mechanical, servo-assisted Lamborghini Dynamic Steering (LDS) has been tuned specifically for the Huracán EVO RWD to offer even more driver feedback.<br>
							The supercar is powered by a naturally aspirated 5.2-liter V10 delivering 610 hp (449 kW) of power at 8,000 rpm and 560 Nm of torque at 6,500 rpm in a model that is even lighter thanks to the front axle losing a driveshaft. The fast-revving ten-cylinder engine is paired with a seven-speed dual clutch gearbox that ensures lightning-fast gear changes. With launch control, the quickest acceleration to 100 kph (62 mph) from a standing start is done in no more than 3.3 seconds. Top speed is also a more than decent 325kph. The Lamborghini Huracan Evo comes as standard with 19 inch Kari wheels engulfed in specially-developed Pirelli P Zero tires. Stopping power is more than enough since the car is fitted with ventilated and cross-drilled steel brakes. Larger 20 inch wheels and carbon-ceramic brakes are optionally available.</p>

							<h1>SIXTH GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Huracan STO 2020-Present)<br><br>
							The three letters from the Hurracan STO came from the Super Trofeo Omologata, which meant a road-legal super sports car developed on the track.<br>
							Lamborghini was one of the greatest carmakers who found a way to offer the same car at various performance levels. Moreover, apart from the factory's management, nobody knew exactly how many new versions would be for the same car. But it wasn't just some posh on the wheels and a new badge on the dash. The STO, for instance, was fierce and competitive. It was the fastest Lamborghini to date.<br>
							The Italian carmaker took its inspiration from the motorsport arena, where it ran the Lamborghini Trofeo race. It was noticed that it was a very good idea to install a single bodywork element that will comprise the hood and the front fenders, so they did that for the SFO and named it "cofango". That allowed them to create new air-ducts on the front hood to increase the airflow through the central radiator and improve engine cooling as well as helping generate downforce. The cofango also incorporated a new front splitter, directing airflow to the car's newly designed underbody and to the rear diffuser. In the rear, there was a new air-scoop to improve the cooling.<br>
							The Hurracan STO interior reflected the lightweight concept of the exterior with the extensive use of carbon fiber throughout the cockpit, including carbon-fiber sport-bucket seats wrapped in Alcantara. Carbon-fiber floor mats replaced the carpets, to reduce weight. Behind the seats, there was a high-grade titanium alloy arch with four-point seatbelts.<br>
							Lamborghini installed an upgraded drivetrain and offered the Hurracan STO with a 640 hp V10 engine. It was paired to a 7-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox, which sent the power to the rear wheels.</p>

							<h1>SEVENTH GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Huracan Tecnica 2022-Present)<br><br>
							Lamborghini introduced another special version of its Huracan in 2022 and brought more life into the aging model that was already eight years old.<br>
							The Huracan was introduced by the Italian automaker back in 2014, and it rocked the supercar world with its 5.2-liter naturally-aspirated V12 that provided more than 600 stallions. In addition, since it was an all-wheel-drive vehicle, it was easier to drive by most people who were afraid to tame that power. In 2019, the Italian automaker introduced a facelifted version but kept its original engine in place, tuned for more performance. So, in 2022, after the STO and the Performante, Lamborghini brought another masterpiece: the Tecnica. This time, the car was a mix between a road-legal car and a track weapon.<br>
							By removing some of the aerodynamic parts that helped the STO be planted to the track, the drag resistance was decreased. Thus, the top speed was slightly raised. But that didn't mean that the Tecnica didn't feature a rear wing to help the driver keep the car on the road during high-speed cornering. It had one, and, in addition, the car also featured an aggressive front bumper fitted with a lip spoiler that increased the downforce for the front axle.<br>
							Inside, the automaker kept the high-bolstered bucket seats for the two occupants, making the cabin more comfortable. That included an infotainment system mounted on the center console and fitted with a touchscreen. In addition, the dashboard was covered in Alcantara, and the hexagonal vents added a luxury flair.<br>
							But the real surprise came from the drivetrain. The Tecnica was tuned for the track, keeping only the rear-wheel drive system. Moreover, Lamborghini offered this version of the Huracan exclusively with a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox.</p>

							<h1>EIGHTH GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Sterrato 2022-Present)<br><br>
							Lamborghini unveiled the most unusual version of the Hurracan in late 2022, the Sterrato, as a rally-oriented supercar, which sounded like a contradiction.<br>
							The Italian supercar manufacturer wasn't involved in off-road, gravel, or any kind of rally races. Its connection with unpaved roads was limited to the older LM002 and the Urus. And then, in 2022, it showcased the Sterrato. It was like nothing else.<br>
							Lamborghini created a mix between a supercar and a Group-B rally car. While the bodywork looked unmistakably similar to a Hurracan, the details told something else. The ground clearance was raised by 44 mm compared to the Hurracan EVO, and the track was wider on both axles. In addition, the front aluminum underbody protection, the reinforced side sills, and the sturdy wheel arches emphasized the car's muscular look. On the roof, besides the functional air intake, Lamborghini also installed roof rails. And if that was unusual for a Lamborghini supercar, then the automaker doubled down with a set of LED fog lamps flanking the car's badge at the front.<br>
							Inside, the rugged appearance of the cabin was softened by the carbon-fiber sports seats wrapped in green leather. There were a few red accents for the door handles, the starter button, and the steering wheel. The infotainment system was on the center stack like on any other Hurracan, but it featured additional, rally-specific settings.<br>
							Behind the cabin, in the engine compartment, Lamborghini installed the same 5.2-liter V10 powerplant that sent its power in all corners via a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox. It was tuned for rally use, for gravel roads.</p>

							<h1>FIRST GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Aventador LP 700-4 2011-2016)<br><br>
							Lamborghini unleashed its creative power and introduced the Aventador in 2011, sending the decade-old Murcielago to a well-deserved retirement.<br>
							It was a new chapter from the book of Lamborghini's creations opened for the first time in 1966 by the Miura, the first V-12, mid-engined vehicle. The car defined all the supercars that followed and introduced the standard for all the high-performance sports cars that followed, either produced by Ferrari, McLaren, Spyker, or Koenigsegg, to name just a few. The only exception was the Porsche 911, but its sibling, the GT1, had the engine placed between the rear axle and the cockpit. After the Miura, the Countach, the Diablo, and the Murcielago raised the bar for everyone. And then, in 2011, from the gates of Lamborghini's factory from Sant'Agata Bolognese came the Aventador.<br>
							The F-117 Stealth Fighter-jet inspired its look. The wedged-shaped supercar featured Y-shaped daytime running lights, and a V-shaped front side pointed toward the road. Its wide, hexagonal air intakes from the bumper resembled those from a fighter jet. From its sides, the very raked windshield left very little headroom inside. The carmaker made two bubbles on the roof for the driver and passenger. The angular shapes continued on the engine lid, which featured a transparent polycarbonate cover above the V-12 mill.<br>
							Filippo Perini, the original project designer, was inspired by military aviation when he made the interior. All buttons and switches looked military-grade, and he didn't use any plastic parts for them. Moreover, the start button was covered by a flip-up red cap, similar to those that prevented accidental launches of a rocket because that was the Aventador, a ground-to-ground wheeled missile.<br>
							Behind the cabin, Lamborghini installed a newly developed 6.5-liter engine naturally aspirated that provided 690 hp to a seven-speed automatic (single-clutch) gearbox developed by Graziano Transmissioni. Its push-road independent suspension in all corners helped the car to stay on the road during high-speed cornering. And if that wasn't enough, an adaptive aerodynamic system increased the downforce.</p>

							<h1>SECOND GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Aventador LP750-4 SV 2015-2017)<br><br>
							Some of the boys who had the Countach posters on their walls grew up and in 2016 they could afford the true offspring of that supercar. And that was the 2016 Lamborghini Aventador SV LP750-4.<br>
							The Y shapes were everywhere present on the supercar. On the short trunk lid upfront, on the fenders, on the 3D front spoiler, and the LED taillights. The angry headlights were full LED and the fixed carbon-fiber wing in the back meant business.<br>
							Sometimes, a special edition of a supercar is just some nicer wheels and special colors. Not the case for the SV LP-750-4. The name said it all: 750 hp and all-wheel-drive. The SV meant Superveloce that can be translated in Superfast. To live up to that name, the Lamborghini engineers added 50 more hp to the Aventador and shaved 50 kg (110 lbs) from its weight. It wasn't only a diet, but a training program. While the removal of the ALA (Lamborghini Active Aerodynamic) cut some weight, then added some kilos in the form of adaptive steering and the magnetorheological dampers. That's where most of the USD 100.000 price difference was spent. The 600 units were produced and sold by July 2017.<br>
							As a result, the car was incredibly fast. On the Nurburgring Nordschleife race track, it ran a little bit slower than the USD 1.000.000 Porsche 918 hybrid supercar.</p>

							<h1>THIRD GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Aventador S 2017-Present)<br><br>
							Lamborghini is known for building more special series from the same base product and that was the case with the Aventador which, in 2017, was introduced in the S-version with 740 hp.<br>
							After it was taken over by the Volkswagen Group, the Lamborghini car-maker started to increase its model range and to diversify each and every model it had on its stable. After six years since it was launched the Aventador received an important upgrade with the S version.<br>
							The exterior design was modified to improve the aerodynamics and the aggressive look. In the front, a new spoiler with body-color and carbon-fiber elements were blended in. From the side, the redesigned rear wheel arch resembled the one from the Countach. In the rear, the center-mounted exhaust was comprised of three angular-shaped pipes into a big, hexagonal, shape. A rear diffuser was installed under the bumper to reduce the ground effect.<br>
							The interior was not very much changed. It still looked like a cockpit from a fighter-jet, with toggle switches and a flap above the engine start button. The bucket-seats were covered in leather and bolstered for side support. The infotainment unit was little upgraded from the original, 2011, Aventador.<br>
							The most important was the 6.5-liter V12 engine placed in front of the rear axle. It was mated to a standard Lamborghini lightweight Independent Shifting Rod (ISR) 7-speed shifting system. The all-wheel-drive and all-wheel-steering super-car was able to hit the 60 mph (96 kph) in under three seconds.</p>

							<h1>FOURTH GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Aventador SVJ 2018-Present)<br><br>
							The Lamborghini Aventador SVJ was showed at the 2018 Monterey Car Week in California and with its limited 900 units production, it will be a collectible vehicle. But a very fast one.<br>
							The name stood for Super Veloce Jota, which can be translated in Super-fast Jota. The Jota suffix denoted the track-oriented vehicle. But it wasn't just a name. The anti-roll bar stiffness has been improved by 50% compared to the Aventador SV, which was already a Super-fast version of the already fast Aventador. The 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox was retuned for the increased power and torque and the all-wheel-drive system had improved torque split to maximize traction and handling.<br>
							The Aventador was not a new vehicle in 2018, but still a respectable car in the fast car world. The limited-edition SVJ took the car to a different level after it broke the Nurburgring lap record for a series production vehicle. Its 6:44.97 minutes time was hard to beat by anyone. In order to achieve that time, the vehicle featured numerous updates.<br>
							One of them was the ALA system, which stands for Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva. An advanced active aerodynamic system that opened and closed various flaps and wings depending on the driving speed and conditions. Some were meant for increase speed, some for downforce. The front bumper was wider and included side fins and new intakes.<br>
							Another special edition, named SVJ 63 played homage to the foundation of the Lamborghini company, in 1963. It had extensive use of carbon-fiber and it was built in a limited number of 63 units.</p>

							<h1>FIFTH GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI LP780-4 Ultimae 2022-Present)<br><br>
							It was the last Aventador, the car that should end the 11 years career of the Italian supercar career after many other special editions. Moreover, it was the final Lamborghini fitted with a naturally aspirated V12 engine.<br>
							As time went by, Lamborghini adopted the strategy of creating special models, which were sold with a lot more money than the regular versions. Although, sometimes, these special editions were not as special as the vehicles they derived from.<br>
							The Ultimae received a redesigned front bumper that increased the downforce. In addition, a splitter and an open air intake optimized the aerodynamics. On the sides, the Ultimae sported the same angular-shaped air intakes for the engine, placed behind the doors but adorned with unique decals. At the back, a three-position active aerodynamic wing kept the car planted on the road at high speeds and at high-speed cornering maneuvers.<br>
							Inside, the cockpit resembled the same fighter-jet-inspired atmosphere, with sport bucket seats deeply sculptured with a Y-pattern on the leather upholstery. The contrast stitching made that even more obvious. At the same time, the Lamborghini logos on the headrests completed the unique image of the Ultimae.<br>
							The Ultimae features a V12 engine behind the cabin like any other Aventador. But, unlike the rest of the range, it offered 780 PS (770 hp) at a sky-high rev range. It was still mated to the same seven-speed (dual-clutch) automatic gearbox and sends the power in all corners. While it's not way faster than the Aventador S, the Ultimae was lighter and nimbler on the race track than its sibling.</p>

							<h1>FIRST GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Urus 2018-Present)<br><br>
							After a long hesitation, if the Lamborghini should launch an SUV or not, the Italian company introduced its contender in the Sport-SUV market: the Urus.<br>
							Back in the '80s, Lamborghini unveiled a very special car: the LM002. It was a weird project made by the Italian company and all 328 units were sold with a high sticker price. It was powered by a V12 Lamborghini Countach engine. It had a top speed limited to 200 kph (124 mph). Fast forward to December 2017 when the Urus was unveiled.<br>
							The angular look of the car resembled other supercars from the Lamborghini stable. Its big front bumper with a huge lower grille and air-intakes made the car look angry. From the side, the swept profile and the sloped rear end were designed in the classic, Lamborghini, look. The black overfenders on the wheel-arches inspired some off-road abilities.<br>
							Inside, the Urus was a clear member of its family. The rectangular shapes and the combination of carbon-fiber and aluminum elements resembled a jet-fighter cockpit. A big digital display was installed on the instrument cluster. The most important shape that contoured the car was the hexagon and that was visible in most of the details inside the car.<br>
							The Urus used the same platform as the Audi Q7/Q8, Bentley Bentayga, and Porsche Cayenne. Under the hood, there was a V8 turbocharged engine sent its power to the all four wheels via an 8-speed automatic transmission, and it featured a biased torque toward the rear wheels.</p>

							<h1>SECOND GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Urus S 2022-Present)<br><br>
							After selling more than 20,000 units of the Urus, the Italian automaker introduced an even more extreme version of the super SUV in the form of the Urus S.<br>
							The SUVs were no longer just those vehicles built for school runs and shopping. They became status icons, and the Urus was one of the most powerful of them. It represented the epitome of high-performance high-riders, on par with the most potent versions of vehicles offered by Porsche, Mercedes-AMG, and BMW X6 in the SUV segment.<br>
							Lamborghini made the Urus S with a distinct look that split it apart from the rest of the range. It sported a new front bumper that incorporated a stainless steel mate black painted skidplate. The redesigned hood was made from carbon fiber and featured a pair of vents on it, which were available in a few color options. From its sides, the super SUV revealed a set of 21” alloy wheels fitted as standard, with options for 22” or 23” alloys.<br>
							Inside, the Urus S was sporty and luxurious at the same time. Its flat-bottom steering wheel and the high-bolstered front bucket seats looked like they were carried over from a supercar. Yet, the automaker offered a choice of two leather-wrapped interiors, named Sportivo and the bi-colored Sophisticated.<br>
							Under the hood, the Urus S received a 16 hp (16.2 PS) increase in the total power output, reaching 666 PS (657 hp). As a result, it could reach the first 100 kph (62 mph) from a standstill in just 3.5 seconds, which was 0.1 seconds faster than on the model it replaced.</p>

							<h1>THIRD GENERATION</h1><br>
							<p>(LAMBORGHINI Urus Performante 2022-Present)<br><br>
							Lamborghini had a long history of producing Performante versions for its supercars, but in 2022 it carried over that technology to its crossover Urus.<br>
							When the Italian carmaker introduced the Urus, the world was stunned. While it wasn't the first high-rider in its history, it was the first designed to storm the high-performance crossover market. When that was not enough for its customers, Lamborghini introduced an even fiercer version: the Performante.<br>
							Lamborghini's Performante vehicles sported modified exteriors when compared to their regular siblings, and so was the Urus. It featured a new, sharper-looking front bumper with distinctive side scoops and a trapezoidal-shaped lower air intake. The hood featured a black center area to reveal the carbon-fiber material used to make it. From its profile, the Urus Performante showed a lowered ground clearance by 20 mm (0.8") due to the new steel suspension. At the back, the spoiler sports carbon-fiber fins resembling those installed on the Aventador SVJ.<br>
							The cockpit's interior features Nero Cosmus black Alcantara as standard, along with the "Performante trim," a new hexagonal seat stitching pattern, and other choices, including leather upholstery. In addition, Ad Personam customization choices include matte carbon fiber accents, red door handles, and a personalized kickplate with the Ad Personam emblem. Both the inside aluminum trim and the black Alcantara/leather steering wheel are finished in matte black. The same finish can be extended to other interior features with the optional "Dark Package," including the lever on the Urus's central "TAMBURO," which houses controls like the start/stop button and drive mode selector.<br>
							On the Performante version, the twin-turbo V8 engine from the Urus gained just 16 hp, which, combined with the lowered weight by 50 kg (110 lbs), led to a lower 0-62 mph (0-100 kph) time, but the same top speed.</p>
